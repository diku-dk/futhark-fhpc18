# Datasets

`verysmall` is hand-written.

`4096nodes` originate from Rodinia, though their input and output formats has
been converted to Futhark's format using the
`data/rodinia_input_to_futhark_input.py` and
`data/rodinia_output_to_futhark_output.py` programs.

`512nodes_high_edge_variance` is generated by `data/gen_datasets.py`, which
does the same as Rodinia's internal `data/bfs/inputGen/graphgen` utility, except
with no duplicate edges.  (`graphgen` might generate duplicate edges, which is
bad, but it only starts potentially failing when the number of edges becomes
large.)


## Benchmarking

The `*_more.fut` programs are used for benchmarking on large datasets.  These
datasets are too large to include in git.  Some of them are generated by the
`data/gen_datasets_more.py` program.  The others are datasets supplied by
Rodinia and converted to the Futhark input format.

See the `benchmarking` directory for scripts that can benchmark Futhark and
Rodinia on the exact same datasets.  Note that these scripts only work if you
have generated the large datasets by running the described Python programs.
